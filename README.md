## Features

- Interactive slingshot mechanic for launching birds
- Float-based physics engine for smooth movement
- Realistic collision detection and response
- Multiple friction models (horizontal, stacking, ground)
- Stability detection system to prevent physics jitter
- Randomized level generation
- Score tracking system
- Multiple bird types with unique visuals
